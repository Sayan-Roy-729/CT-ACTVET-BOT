If the question is not related to the previous responses then output the same question as inputted. If you are not confident on whether the question is related to previous responses, then output the same question.
If you think there is no need to rephrase then reply with the same User Query without rephrasing it and changing any context of the Query.
If in the user query has any context to plot graphs or to show in tabular format, then you have to add that to your rephrased query as well.

## prompt to generate the SQL query with the row level access
sql_generate_prompt_with_row_level = f"""
    Your role is to understand user's QUESTION and transform that into SQL query based on a specific dataset schema.

    DATA INFORMATION:
    - QUESTION: User's query according to which you have to generate the SQL query.
    - DATABASE_NAME: The SQL database name from which you have provided the SCHEMA.
    - TABLE_NAME: The table name present into the DATABASE_NAME.
    - COLUMN_NAMES: The list of column names of the table TABLE_NAME. You only have to use these column names only as it is to generate the SQL query.
    - SCHEMA: You are given a small amount of data as a markdown format of the TABLE_NAME, to help you to understand the schema.
    - ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS: SQL query to tell you that the user only has the access to specific rows only. For example, "SELECT ORG_SRGT FROM HR.DIM_ORGANIZATION WHERE ORG_AUTHORITY='IAT'", for this SQL query, the user has the access to those rows only which has ORG_AUTHORITY == 'IAT' for the DIM_ORGANIZATION table.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - The DATABASE_NAME, TABLE_NAME, SCHEMA & ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS will repeat 4 to 5 times for different SQL tables. Each iteration tells the details for the SQL table.
    - According to the QUESTION, you have to choose the most appropriate SQL table and the most required column names only while generating the SQL query.
    - Select only the relevant column names from the given SCHEMA. Don't select all the column names like "SELECT *".
    - In the SQL query, use the DATABASE_NAME.TABLE_NAME after the FROM part of the query from where you retrieve the data.
    - Pick the table name from the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS and do the inner join with your choosed SQL table. If the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS like "SELECT A FROM table1", the column name A is the important column to do the join operation. 
    - If in the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS has the conditions like "WHERE ...", then add this also to your generated query. For more understanding, see the EXAMPLE section.
    - For the table name of the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS, always use this format "actvet_uc.gold.table1" where "table1" is picked up by you from the SQL query. If the table present as "name1.name2", then also you have modify to "actvet_uc.gold.name2".
    - Add semicolon (;) at the end of the SQL query so that it is ended properly.
    - While creating aliasing, don't put the square brackets, [], instead follow the Snakecase naming style. 
    - If you can't generate the SQL query, then return back the response as "NO SQL QUESTION CAN BE GENERATED." in the JSON format.
    - Try to make the SQL query as simple as possible by understanding the QUESTION properly.
    - If the related attribute(s) are not present in the COLUMN_NAMES but asked in the QUESTION, then you can ignore that attribute(s) in the SQL query.

    EXAMPLE:
    ```
    Example 1:

# add the row level SQL query to the generated SQL query
modify_sql_query_with_row_level = f"""
You have to join the given SQL query with the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS query to get the final SQL query.

DATA INFORMATION:
- ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS: The SQL query to tell you that the user only has the access to specific rows only. For example, "SELECT ORG_SRGT FROM HR.DIM_ORGANIZATION WHERE ORG_AUTHORITY='IAT'", for this SQL query, the user has the access to those rows only which has ORG_AUTHORITY == 'IAT' for the DIM_ORGANIZATION table.
- ROW_LEVEL_COLUMN_NAME: The column name present in the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS query which is important to do the join operation.
- SQL_QUERY: The SQL query which you have to modify based on the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS query.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- You have to join the SQL_QUERY with the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS query based on the ROW_LEVEL_COLUMN_NAME.
- If the ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS has the conditions like "WHERE ...", then add this also to your final query.
- Add semicolon (;) at the end of the SQL query so that it is ended properly.

EXAMPLE:
```
ROW_LEVEL_ACCESS: SELECT ACDORG_SRGT FROM DIM_ACADEMIC_ORGANIZATION WHERE ACDORG_ENTITY IN ('ADPOLY','FCHS','ATS','ATHS')
ROW_LEVEL_COLUMN_NAME: ACDORG_SRGT
SQL_QUERY: SELECT AVG(survey_result) AS overall_satisfaction_percentage FROM actvet_uc.gold.iat_student_survey WHERE year = 2021;
